					<p>Waterloo Brewing came into being long before the craft beer hysteria that grips our culture today. We are, quite simply, the result of a thirst for terrific tasting beer, which we had in common with our friends and neighbours. Back then, we took to brewing small batches, by hand, from four simple ingredients. Today, we humbly lay claim to the honour of being not only Ontario’s first craft brewer but also its largest. Though our recipe – fresh, handmade, simple ingredients – hasn’t budged. As the thirst for exceptional craft beers has spread, we’ve kept our heads down and stayed true to what we believe are deeply shared K-W values of quality, craftsmanship and a spirit of innovation. That’s meant having to sort through how we can continue to pioneer craft beer culture, while also finding ways to brew responsibly to the environment and a community that we’re as fond of as we are fond of beer. Today, we still create balanced, thoughtful beers that riff on traditional styles. We just happen to have grown bigger, and we hope a little wiser, in how we brew.</p><br>
