				<h2>Block Three Brewing Company</h2><br>
				<article class="sectionarticle">
					<p>Block Three is a microbrewery proudly located in the village of St. Jacobs. Since 2013, we have been focused on artisan small-batch beers that showcase the craftsmanship of our brewers. The idea of block 3 came from just a few buddies hanging out having a good time we decided that we want to have like a little beer club hang out with the boys so we said it'd be awesome to just start making our own beer and maybe trying to sell it we looked around at our hometown and we saw that there was a need that was being missed here in St. Jacob's so we decided that we'd come on in and try to get a little boutique brewery going you want people when they come in to feel like they're at home just trying to set a nice atmosphere free samples free tours mostly guys thought we were crazy but at the end of the day here we are so we're pretty pumped about it our beer is very very fresh we're literally pulling off batches on on a Wednesday and selling it Thursday.</p><br>
