					<p>The Regional Municipality of Waterloo is a regional municipality located in Southern Ontario, Canada. It consists of the cities of Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo (collectively called the Tri-Cities), and the townships of North Dumfries, Wellesley, Wilmot and Woolwich. It is often referred to as the Region of Waterloo or Waterloo Region. The region is 1,369 square kilometres in size and its regional seat of government is in Kitchener. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Municipality_of_Waterloo">(from Wikipedia, enciclopedia online, Oct 2019)</a></p>
					<p>Though the area is known for having the largest Oktoberfest celebration outside of Germany, KW’s craft beer scene is on point all year round. I swear new breweries popping up every time I turn around! The best part is that they’re all incredible, creating unique brews that stand out amongst the crowd. Not to be taken lightly, these Kitchener-Waterloo Breweries are sure to satisfy a number of beer palettes. Also, you know it’s going to be a good post when there’s a beer pun right in the title.

						<h3>Block 3</h3>
						<p>Block Three is a microbrewery proudly located in the village of St. Jacobs. Since 2013, we have been focused on artisan small-batch beers that showcase the craftsmanship of our brewers. The idea of block 3 came from just a few buddies hanging out having a good time we decided that we want to have like a little beer club hang out with the boys so we said it'd be awesome to just start making our own beer.</p>

						<h3>Waterloo Brewing</h3>
						<p>Waterloo Brewing came into being long before the craft beer hysteria that grips our culture today. We are, quite simply, the result of a thirst for terrific tasting beer, which we had in common with our friends and neighbours. Back then, we took to brewing small batches, by hand, from four simple ingredients. Today, we humbly lay claim to the honour of being not only Ontario’s first.</p>
